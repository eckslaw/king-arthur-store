The computer game combines several elements: a static Game Map together with dynamic challenges in special windows, namely the Memory Challenge and the Video Challenge.

The Memory Challenge primarily requires a keen sense of observation. The solution is entered by mouse clicks.

The Video Challenge is a vintage video game, naturally realised using actual technology stuff. Control of the player character is achieved by using the mouse buttons and the scroll wheel.

As a narrative framework, the game draws upon the legend of King Arthur, combined with elements of medieval knighthood. Within the game, the player progresses through the stages leading to knighthood: Page, Squire, and Knight.

As a crowning finale, particularly skilful players may succeed in conquering the crown for Arthur. At this point, the ultimate goal of the game is achieved: Arthur not only attains the dignity of knighthood, but also the royal crown. He becomes the legendary King Arthur.
